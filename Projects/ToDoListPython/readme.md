# 📝 Python Command-Line To-Do List App

This project is a simple yet functional command-line To-Do List application built in Python. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, viewing, completing, and deleting them. Tasks are stored in a text file, ensuring they remain available even after the app is closed.

## 🚀 Features
- **Task Management**: Easily add new tasks, view all tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks permanently.
- **Data Persistence**: All tasks are stored in a `tasks.txt` file, so your list remains available across sessions.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Lightweight command-line interface without dependencies, making it easy to run on any system.
- **Modular Code Structure**: The code is organized into functions, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## 🛠️ Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saimounikanedunuri/365daysOfCode/Projects/ToDoListPython/todo-list-app.git
    cd todo-list-app
    ```

2. **Run the App**:
    ```bash
    python todo.py
    ```

3. **Features Menu**:
    - **1. View Tasks** - Displays all current tasks.
    - **2. Add Task** - Prompts the user to add a new task.
    - **3. Complete Task** - Marks a task as completed and removes it from the list.
    - **4. Delete Task** - Permanently deletes a task from the list.
    - **5. Exit** - Closes the app.

## 📂 Files Included
- **`todo.py`** - The main script containing the logic for the to-do list app.
- **`tasks.txt`** - A text file that serves as a simple storage for tasks.

## 🔄 Future Enhancements
This app can be further developed with:
- **Database Integration**: Replace the text file with a database for more scalable and robust data storage.
- **Task Categories and Prioritization**: Enable users to categorize tasks by priority or type.
- **Deadline and Reminder Features**: Add functionality to set due dates and receive notifications.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Build a GUI for a more intuitive, user-friendly experience.

## 💡 Key Learnings
Through this project, I reinforced my knowledge of Python fundamentals, file handling, and command-line interfaces. This project also enabled me to understand the importance of data persistence, modular coding practices, and user-centered design in software development.
