ðŸŒŸ Practical Techniques in Data Engineering on AWS ðŸŒŸ

In data engineering, making processes traceable and efficient is key. Here are some practical techniques, with examples, that help bring clarity and order to data workflows:

Unique IDs for Each Script Run
Generating a unique ID for every script run helps track each process separately. This "fingerprint" makes it easier to review logs and troubleshoot:

python
Copy code
script_run_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  # Creates a unique ID for each run
Counting Active Files
Knowing how many files are actively processed is important, especially with large datasets. A global counter keeps track of this:

python
Copy code
global Active_Files_Count  # Counts files in process to monitor progress
Metadata Tables for Data Insights
Metadata tables store information about each datasetâ€™s origin, state, and other important attributes. This quick-reference structure improves data quality and consistency, making it easier to locate specific information about datasets when needed.

Organized Logging for Transparency
A structured logging setup captures key details at every step, making it easy to monitor and analyze. Hereâ€™s an example:

python
Copy code
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=log_file,
    filemode='w',
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)-25s - %(threadName)-12s - %(levelname)-5s - %(message)s'
)
logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())
This setup logs:

Timestamp (when each action occurs)
Thread name (important for multi-tasking)
Message (for detailed context)
Recording Script Start Times
Recording the script's start time allows for easy performance analysis:

python
Copy code
start_time = str(time.strftime("%H:%M:%S"))  # Logs when the script begins
