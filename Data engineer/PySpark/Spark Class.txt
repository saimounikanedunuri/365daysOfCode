Diffrent between Spark 1.x and Spark 2.x ? or diffrence between spark context and spark session ?
=====================================================================

Spark Context : 
------------------
-> Prior to Spark 2.0, Spark context was entry point of all spark jobs.
-> For each context, one API is required.
   eg : 
	For hive, hive context is required.
	For sql, SQL context is required.
	For steaming, Streaming context is required.

Spark Session : 
------------------
-> Spark 2.0 onwards, Spark session is entry point of all spark jobs.
-> All API's are available in Spark Session.

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("first programm").getOrCreate()




Spark Architecture :
====================

	PySpark's architecture consists of the following components:

	Spark Driver: 
	-------------
		The Spark Driver is responsible to run program and creates the SparkSession, which is the entry point for creating RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets.

	SparkSession: 
	-------------
		The SparkSession is the entry point for creating RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets. It is responsible for coordinating the Spark application and executing the user's code on the cluster.

	Cluster Manager:  yarn/ Mesos and and Standalone.
	---------------
		The Cluster Manager is responsible for managing the resources (CPU, memory, and disk) of the cluster. PySpark supports different cluster managers such as YARN, Mesos, and Standalone.

	Executors: 
	-----------
		Executors are the worker nodes that run the tasks and store the data in memory or disk. Each executor runs on a separate node in the cluster.


Lazy Evaluation :  Transformations(lazy) and Actions 
------------------
	Lazy evaluation in PySpark is a technique where transformations on RDDs are not executed immediately. Instead, they are recorded by PySpark and are only executed when an action is called on the RDD.
		eg :
			# rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1,2])
			# new_rdd = rdd.map(lambda x :  x+2)
			# print(new_rdd)
			# print(new_rdd.collect())

Partition :
---------------
	-> In PySpark, a partition is a small, logical chunk of data that is stored and processed on a single node of a distributed system. An RDD in PySpark is divided into several partitions, with each partition containing a subset of the data.
	-> partition can be controlled by user.
		eg :
			rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
			print(rdd.getNumPartitions())
			new_rdd = rdd.repartition(15)
			print(new_rdd.getNumPartitions())


rdd and transformations : Both are immutable.
=============================================

Data Types :
==============
int,
str,
boolean,
list  -----> mutable
tuple,
dict,
set,  ----> immutable

Spark : 
========
rdd :    Transformations(Manupulations/calculations) + Actions(Print/ data save)  -> NO SQL support
dataframe : Transformations(Manupulations/calculations) + Actions(Print/ data save)  -> SQL support
dataset : pyspark doesn't support datasets.




Spark RDD(Resilient distributed dataset) :
=============
	-> An RDD is an immutable distributed collection of objects that can be processed in parallel across a cluster of computers.
	-> It allows for scalable and fault-tolerant data processing by automatically handling the distribution of data and computation across the nodes in the cluster.
	-> RDD doesn't allow to write SQL queries.
	-> RDD provides low level API.
	
	Main properties of RDDs are:
	---------------------------------
		Immutable: Once created, an RDD cannot be changed, but it can be transformed into a new RDD through operations such as map, filter, and reduce.

		Distributed: RDDs are partitioned and distributed across the nodes in the cluster, allowing for parallel processing.

		Resilient: RDDs are fault-tolerant, meaning that they can recover from failures by recomputing lost partitions from the other nodes.
		
	RDD's can be created from multiple sources :
	-----------------------------------------------
	
		1. Local collections: lists or arrays to RDD
			rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
			
		2. External datasets: HDFS or Local file system.
			rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile("hdfs://path/to/file")
		
		3. Transformation of existing RDDs: New RDDs can be created by applying transformations to existing RDDs
			rdd1 = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
			rdd2 = rdd1.map(lambda x: x * 2)
		
		4. From databases: NoSQL (Cassandra,HBase), or JDBC-compatible databases, using Spark's built-in connectors.
			df = spark.read.format("jdbc").option("url", "jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase").option("dbtable", "mytable").load()
			rdd = df.rdd
			
		5. EmptyRDD : 
			rdd = spark.sparkContext.emptyRDD()

	
	RDD data sets are processed using transformations and actions.
	===============================================================
		Transformations :
		==================
		-> Transformations are operations that create a new RDD from an existing RDD.
		-> RDD's are Immutable that means it won't modify.
		-> Transformations are performed lazily, which means that they do not execute immediately when they are called.
		-> When we call Action, All series for transformations are processed.

		Q2 : What is diffrence between repartition() and coalesce() :
			repartition() : 
				-> This is one of the performance techinique in spark.
				-> When we want to increase number of partitions than existing, We use repartition() techinique.

				-> When we want to descrease number of partitions than existing, We user coalesce() techinique.
				
		Q3 : What is diffrence between groupByKey() and reduceByKey() ?
			groupByKey() :
				When we choose groupByKey(), Data will go one node first, Then apply grouping.
				
				5 machines(nodes) = 5GB  that means 1 node is processing 1GB data.

			print(new_rdd.collect())
			
				
				
					
		Actions :
		============
		-> In PySpark RDD, transformations are lazy operations that are only executed when an action is called on the RDD. 
		-> Actions are operations that trigger computation on the RDD and return results or write data to an external storage system.

Spark DataFrame  : 
=====================
-> In PySpark, a data frame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns.
-> It is similar to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R or Python's Pandas library. 
-> DataFrame is created in In-memory in table format.
-> Data frames are the primary abstraction for data processing in PySpark and provide a convenient and efficient way to work with large datasets.
-> PySpark data frames are built on top of Apache Spark's Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) and provide a higher-level API for manipulating data. 
-> They support various operations such as filtering, selecting, grouping, joining, and aggregating data, which can be performed in a distributed and parallelized manner.

	Advantages of DataFrames in pyspark :
	=======================================
	Schema enforcement:
	------------------
		PySpark data frames enforce a schema on the data, which means that every column has a well-defined data type. This helps to avoid type errors and makes it easier to work with the data.

	Better performance:
	-------------------
		PySpark data frames use a columnar storage format and offer several optimization techniques such as predicate pushdown, projection pruning, and code generation, which make them faster and more efficient than RDDs.

	Higher-level API:
	------------------
		PySpark data frames provide a higher-level API for data manipulation, which is more concise and easier to understand than the lower-level API of RDDs. This makes it easier for developers to write complex data processing pipelines.

	Integration with SQL:
	----------------------
		PySpark data frames can be easily converted to SQL tables and can be queried using SQL syntax. This makes it easier to integrate PySpark with existing SQL-based tools and databases.
	
	
	Multiple ways to create DataFrame in PySpark :
	==============================================
	Create a data frame from an RDD: You can create a data frame from an existing RDD using the toDF() method.
	--------------------------------
		eg :
			rdd = sc.parallelize([(1, "John", 25), (2, "Jane", 30), (3, "Bob", 35)])
			df = rdd.toDF(["id", "name", "age"])
			df.show()
			
			
	Create a data frame from a CSV file: You can create a data frame from a CSV file using the read.csv() method.
	------------------------------------
		eg :
			df = spark.read.csv("path/to/file.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
			df.show()
			
	
	Create a data frame from a JSON file: You can create a data frame from a JSON file using the read.json() method.
	-------------------------------------
		eg :
			df = spark.read.json("path/to/file.json")
			df.show()
			
	
	Create a data frame from a Parquet file: You can create a data frame from a Parquet file using the read.parquet() method.
	----------------------------------------
		eg :
			df = spark.read.parquet("path/to/file.parquet")
			df.show()
			
	
	Create a data frame from a SQL query: You can create a data frame from a SQL query using the spark.sql() method.
	--------------------------------------
		eg :
			df = spark.sql("SELECT id, name, age FROM people WHERE age > 30")
			df.show()
			
	
	Create a data frame from a list of dictionaries: You can create a data frame from a list of dictionaries using the createDataFrame() method.
	-------------------------------------------------
		eg :
			data = [{"id": 1, "name": "John", "age": 25},
					{"id": 2, "name": "Jane", "age": 30},
					{"id": 3, "name": "Bob", "age": 35}]
			df = spark.createDataFrame(data)
			df.show()
			
	Create DataFrame from RDBMS :
	-------------------------------
		jdbc_url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:22/retail_db"
		creds = {
			"username" : "root",
			"password" : "cloudera",
			"driver": "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
		}
		df = spark.read.jdbc(url=jdbc_url, properties=creds, table="emp")
